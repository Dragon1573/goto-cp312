# goto-cp312

A simple package that provide limited supports of `goto` keyword like C/C++.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This package is only tested locally on Windows `amd64` on CPython 3.12.2. Use this package with caution!

## Usage

```python
from goto import GOTO, LABEL, with_goto

@with_goto
def example_01() -> None:
    print("Hello, ")
    GOTO.label_01
    print("Skipped!")
    LABEL.label_01
    print("world!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_01()
```

## How this work

1. Disassemble the raw function.
2. Iterate over the disassembled contents.
3. If thereâ€˜re `LOAD_GLOBAL (GOTO)`, `LOAD_ATTR` and `POP_TOP` in continuing 3 lines, note down the byte position and the label, it's where we jump from.
4. Hack full byte range of above 3 operations to `NOP`, except the first 2 bytes of `LOAD_GLOBAL`.
5. If there're `LOAD_GLOBAL (LABEL)`, `LOAD_ATTR` and `POP_TOP` in continuing 3 lines, note down the byte position the next line of `POP_TOP` and the label, it's where we jump to.
5. Hack full byte range of above 3 operations to `NOP`.
6. Iterate over all `(label, from_, to)` pair, check if `from_` is smaller than `to`, to determine there should be `JUMP_FORWARD` or `JUMP_BACKWARD`.
7. Hack the `from_` byte position to `JUMP_FORWARD` or `JUMP_BACKWARD` according to step 7. If `from_` is far away from `to` (jump more than 256 operations), add necessary `EXTENDED_ARG`.

## Limitations

- It's able to jump out from nested loop (`for` or `while`), but you can't jump into them.
- There're 3 `EXTENDED_ARG` operation before other operations at most, means that the jumping gap is no more than 4G. You can't jump such that HUGE distance. (This limitation has no chance to reach for human-written source code)
- You can't jump to somewhere if they are "dead code" (Python intepreter will remove them directly), such as ...
  - Jump out from a `while True` loop, as the following snippets is unreachable
